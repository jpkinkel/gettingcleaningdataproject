The run_analysis.r runs on the data provided in the folder data to:

- merge the training and test set
- take only the columns that represent means and standard deviations (the result being 79 columns)
- calculate per columns the mean for each subject and each activity 

The resulting dataset is saved as tidydataset.txt and is described by codebook.txt.
